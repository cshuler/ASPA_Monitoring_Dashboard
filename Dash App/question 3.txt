matching corners of 3x3 over 4x4
excluding other cells that you're not hovering over - only computed for poitions where entire kernel fits

only picked relu that gives best score
take max value of each 2x2 of input
will pick the maximum of the convolutional layers
max pooling max value is 516

max pooling reduces network complexity and prevents overfitting while keeping most important factors

then use second conv layer to extract higher level features from output of first conv layer
reduced spatial dimensions before, so we are adding them back in so we focus on a section

second takes output of first
then calc dot prod between kernel 2 and output for maxpooling from kernel 1
apply sigmoid to conv layer 2
gives us probability matrix

we pick max prob in that matrix (.987 > 0.5) so it is predicting "L"
